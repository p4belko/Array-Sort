# Array-Sort
A program written in C to create and sort an array using various algorithms.


Both sorting algorithms sorted the same numeric field that was filled with randomly generated numbers. The size and range of randomly generated numbers is defined by the user when the program is started. The user has also defined the number of individual tests for the specified number of fields elements. The program also measured the time of each sort of elements in the array and checked whether these field were sorted in the correct order. In conclusion, it is evaluated which algorithm is more effective based on the results of average test times.
